# stock-price-prediction
### Introduction
Predicting stock prices is a cumbersome task as it does not follow any specific pattern. Changes in the stock prices are purely based on supply and demand during a period of time. In order to learn the specific characteristics of a stock price, we can use algorithm to identify these patterns through machine learning. One of the most well-known networks for series forecasting is LSTM (long short-term memory) which is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is able to remember information over a long period of time, thus making them extremely useful for predicting stock prices. RNNs are well-suited to time series data and they are able to process the data step-by-step, maintaining an internal state where they cache the information they have seen so far in a summarised version. The successful prediction of a stock's future price could yield a significant profit.
### Objectives
